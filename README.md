# HELIOS_Si7021

A common driver supporting the SI7021 temperature and humidity for Arduino and Mbed OS. I started with the Adafruit's Si7021 driver for Arduino and spending significant development time into this. Later on I started over to create a Si7021 driver for Mbed OS. Now I combined the Mbed OS and Arduino versions into a single source.

# Suppported platforms
- Mbed OS
- Arduino (ESP32 has been tested)


## TODOs
- Arduino: add variable IO pins for I2C (multiple I2C's, ESP32 pin redirect)

##  Credits
This driver has initially been written by the RadioShuttle engineers (www.radioshuttle.de). Many thanks to everyone who helped to bring this project forward.
